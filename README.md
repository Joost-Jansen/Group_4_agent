# Spoonie: A Food Recommendation Agent

## Overview

Spoonie is a conversational agent designed to provide personalized food recommendations. Developed at Delft University of Technology, this project explores the impact of long-term and one-shot memory modules on the user experience in recipe recommendation systems. By engaging in conversations, Spoonie learns user preferences to suggest meals, improving its recommendations over multiple encounters. Full details are provided in the following [paper](spoonie_paper.pdf).

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: Utilizes user preferences for tailored meal suggestions.
- **Memory Modules**: Employs short-term, long-term, and one-shot memory for enhanced interaction.
- **User Experience Study**: Includes a comparative study on the effects of different memory settings on user satisfaction.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. **Configuration**: Setup the Furhat SDK and ensure OpenCV is configured for visual perception.
3. **Running Spoonie**: Follow the instructions in the `docs` folder to start the agent.

## Experiment and Evaluation

- Participants interact with Spoonie across sessions, with data collected to evaluate the impact of memory modules.
- The project employs standard questionnaires for user experience assessment.
